This is a fairly simple application for performing ajax validation of forms 
created using Django's forms system.  Currently it only works with jQuery.

This is mostly a re-write of `django-ajax-validation  <https://github.com/alex/django-ajax-validation>`_.
Which replaces the view by a mixin and some improved jQuery callback handling.
